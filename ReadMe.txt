Method 1: Linear Probing
1. This method has us look at the originally desired space that
the numerical equvilent of the string would like to go into. 
If that space is already occupied then the code will look at 
the next spot in the hash table and repeat the pattern. 
2. This method appears to average between 8.5 secs and 10.5 secs
for both title and quote.
3. This method has a high number of collisions with 87862536 for 
titles and 92779694 for quotes
4. Both of these methods provide no wasted space.
5. This method provides the benifit of using every space but With
the disadvantage of taking a long time with a lot of collisions.
